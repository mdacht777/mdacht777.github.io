I've done a lot of jobs in my life and somehow it always comes back to programming.  As a chiropractor, I needed a way to "supplement" what I was not able to find in my practice management software.  I made a few parallel tools that eventually grew-up to become and replace the practice management software that it was originally created to augment.  That application has been running my practice for the last 15 years.  As a helicopter pilot, I needed a way to automate pre-flight steps and procedures and eventually created an industry-recognized web-based "Flight Risk Assessment and Mitigation Tool" still in use today.  As a director of a college-level helicopter flight training program, I needed a way to track and manage my students.  And on and on ...  The only problem was that all of my knowledge was self-taught.  I could find out how to do almost anything in a book or on the internet and I'm a very good problem solver.  If I would try something and get an error, I was pretty much able to trace back to find what was causing it.  My knowledge was also aging - quickly.  I wanted to have the opportunity to pursue some sort of career in programming but I knew that being self-taught would be a hard sell.  I needed to find a way to provide some credibility to my knowledge and bring myself up to current in programming languages.  I found the Flatiron School program and just decided to jump in.  Now I'm just looking for the doors to open.  I can't wait to see what the future holds and I'm optimistic!
