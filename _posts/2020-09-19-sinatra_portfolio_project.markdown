Second project in the books!  Writing the Sinatra project was closer to what I've been doing for years but with the Sinatra routes and controllers - just a little bit of a stretch.  Nothing insurmountable just enough to challenge me.  Through the course of the project I kept wondering what led to the "route" method for web programming.  My best guess is that with traditional web programming, the "route" was essentially your file structure and maybe that left doors open to mischief.  If you had a url with a "/" you could pretty much count on knowing or being able to easily trace the path of your directory structure.  With routes, your file structure is essentially hidden from any sort of access, unless you know where to find it.  I would imagine Rails makes the process even more streamlined as that seems to be the route of progress for the course - learn to do things the manual way then learn about something that does more of it for you (learning SQL and then learning ActiveRecord, for example).  I love to learn and this course is definitely filling that need for me!  I'm excited to see what's next!
