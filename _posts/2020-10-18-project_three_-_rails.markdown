This one was a little more of a challenge for me.  Rails conventions are very similar and very different from what I've done before.  Routing was a new experience with Sinatra and even more elusive with Rails.  I've mentioned this before so no need to go into it again.  I *think* I'm getting the hang of it but am also certain that only the surface has been scraped.  Learning the associations and figuring out the join table when I've just  been used to joining with SQL came a little easier.  I would imagine my previous experience with databases played a huge role in that ease.  I think the biggest challenge is coming up with a concept in the first place.  I took my previous project and expanded it to make it fit into the specified requirements for the project.  It has some qualities of the previous one but in other ways is very different.  I've heard conflicting information on whether to style it or leave as base-functional.  I've heard that follow-on projects focus more on stying and decided to stick with base-functional.  "It's not pretty" - is one of my favorite ways to describe a lot of my work.  I hope that as I move through the next course sections that my skills in styling progress so that I can one day I can say ... "Oh, it's sooooo pretty".  I'll keep you posted. ; )
