One thing I have learned over the course of working on the projects is that "self-paced" does not mean "you are alone".  Even though you are not sitting in a classroom in front of an instructor, the resources you have available to you are abundant.  

First off, and the most prominently presented: the Study Groups - there's a menu at the top of the screen, you'll see information about them every time you login and the sidebar of every lesson and lab will alert you of the next upcoming groups.  They are literally impossible to miss.  There are study groups for every level of your progress.  Find them and make time to attend them.  Even if you are not ready to start your project - just be there and listen.  Some things won't make sense because they are ahead of your progress or level but listen anyway.  Make notes of things that you don't understand so that it will catch your attention when you do get to that level.  Some groups are recorded so you can watch them later.  Be sure to ask the group host instructor how you can find recordings.

Next, use the “Learn Instruct” video lecture library (https://instruction.learn.co).  You can search by topic and find video lectures for every module, most sections and even some of the most challenging labs.  You can find “live build” series for each project that you can code-along to.  If you have problems finding something in the library, someone in Slack or the study groups usually knows how to find one.

Did I mention? - there are “live build” video series.  Each one also has a repo that you can use as a resource for your own project.  I’ve actually taken these videos and converted them to audio only and then listened to them while I’m driving.  You can learn a lot just from listening.  If I find there’s something I can’t visualize, then I go back and watch that portion of the video.

There are so many resources - you never have to feel like you are working through this alone.  Good luck!
